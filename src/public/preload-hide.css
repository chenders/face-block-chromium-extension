/**
 * Face Block Browser Extension - Preload Image Hiding
 *
 * This CSS is injected by the browser at the engine level (via manifest.json)
 * before any JavaScript runs, ensuring zero flash of unwanted images.
 *
 * The hiding only activates when the html element has the data-face-block-active
 * attribute, which is set by preload.js and removed by content.js after processing.
 *
 * This approach is framework-agnostic and doesn't interfere with SSR frameworks
 * like Next.js because the CSS is never inserted as a DOM element.
